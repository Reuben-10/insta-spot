# 📸 Insta-Spot

Welcome to **Insta-Spot** – a modern, responsive photo-sharing web app inspired by the best of Instagram and Pinterest.

Originally, this project began as a collaborative effort using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I later rebuilt it from the ground up in **React** to take advantage of component-based architecture and a smoother user experience.

## 🚀 About the Project

This project was first introduced as a group assignment at AltSchool Africa’s Tinyuka School of Engineering, guided by [Mr. Oluwasetemi Ojo](https://github.com/Oluwasetemi). After our team completed the initial version, we were each challenged to convert it into a fully functional React application.

> **Initial goal:** Build a profile page with a photo grid, enable editing the profile, allow users to add new posts, and make images previewable in a modal – all as a team.
>
> **Next step:** Reimagine and implement the project as a React app, adding my own improvements and style.
